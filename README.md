# Obscounter

Python implementation of hotkey counter in OBS Studio.

# Requirements

For Windows install [python3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/) 64 or 32 bit depending on your OBS. Since 28 version OBS Studio supports most 3.x Python versions.

# Installation 

1. Download [source code](https://github.com/upgradeQ/Obscounter/archive/master.zip).
2. Unzip the file to be able to access `hotkey_counter.py`. Remember the file location because you will need this later.

# Usage

1. On OBS, under Sources, click + to create a new text source (below, you will see Text GDI+). You may leave it blank.
> [!NOTE]
> You can also use FreeType2 (which is hidden in Depricated) as it's more efficient

## How do I use more counters?

If you need additional counters, duplicate the `hotkey_counter.py` file and save it with a new filename (e.g. `hotkey_counter2.py`), and repeat the process.


# Alternatives

There is a [`Lua alternative`](https://gist.github.com/tid-kijyun/477c723ea42d22903ebe6b6cee3f77a1) with helpful blogpost (JP)
on how to install and setup those kinds of scripts in OBS. Lua support in OBS Studio is built-in , so you don't need install anything extra.
